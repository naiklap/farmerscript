<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![FarmerScript Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://farmerscript.online)

Farmers World is a play-to-earn game based on the WAX blockchain, where you have to mine resources, harvest plantations and feed your animals, where each entity is an NFT.

I created FarmerScript in order to automate this whole process, so that everyone can enjoy the benefits of the game without spending all their time on it.
